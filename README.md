# Flask Mega-Tutorial
This repo contains the code I write as I follow along with
[Miguel Grinberg's](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/index) awesome [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) series.

# Usage
It's simple. After cloning or forking this repo and activating a fresh Python3.6 conda environment, run the following commands from the root of the project directory:
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ flask run
```
The app can then be accessed at `http://localhost:5000`.
